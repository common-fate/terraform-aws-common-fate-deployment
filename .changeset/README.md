# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

2. If you are ready to release this change, Merge the automated changesets PR `Version Packages for main` this will tag and release a new version

## Backporting changes to older minor versions

1. Check for an existing release branch e.g `release/v1.*` for the minor version you are back porting to
2. If the branch doesn't exist, checkout the commit associated with the minor release you want to backport to
3. Run `./create-minor-release.sh` and when prompted set the release branch version e.g `v1.1` or `v1.2` excluding the patch version
4. Push the branch
5. You can now push your changes to this release branch, you may choose to cherrypick the patch from main
6. Create a patch changeset and merge it to the release branch `pnpm changeset`
7. If you are ready to release this change, Merge the automated changesets PR matching your release branch `Version Packages for release/v1.*` this will tag and release a new version
